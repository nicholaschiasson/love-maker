MAKE SOME LOVE WITH LÖVE MAKER

A simple one-click .exe maker for your LÖVE games!

How-to
------

To build your LÖVE game executable, place this folder into the top of your project tree then run the "make.sh" file!

Before running the make script, it may be necessary to open it in a text editor and modify the source and binaries location variables.

Also, to make things easier for you and not invade your personal code bubble, I've made this all work from this directory, however, for ease of use, you may want to create a shortcut to the "make.sh" file and place that wherever you'd like.
